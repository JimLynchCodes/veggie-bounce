## Veggie Bounce 
###### A Spritekit Game by Jim Lynch

### About
This is veggie bounce. Veggie Bounce is an objective-C game for iphones and ipads. It was made in xcode and is built on the Spritekit framework. From a user's perspective Veggie Bounce is a relatively simple game where you collect as many points as possible while keeping the veggies from falling past the bottom of the screen. 

### Purpose
There are a few reaons why I created this game. One is to use this as an official code sample for myself as I try to obtain a position as an Ios developer and programmer. After working on employers' projects using the standard storyboard method I wanted to give Spritekit a go and make a game with some interesting physics. Finally, I made this app for the public so that novice Ios developers can take a look at the code and get some ideas for their own projects.  

### How to Run the Project
The way to play the game is to run it in xcode. Open the project (veggie-bounce/Veg Bounce/Veg Bounce.xcodeproj) and click run. The app should work on Iphones 5, 5s, 6, and 6plus. It should also run fine on Ipad retina and Ipad air. You may need to change the file paths of frameworks to reflet the location on your own computer.

### Special Thanks
I'd like to thank the following people for helping to make this game possible. 

**Matthew Gabor** - Matt has been a good friend of mine for a while. He initially pulled me into objective-C programming when I so stubbornly only wanted to use Adobe AIR for mobile apps. He also brought Spritekit to my attention and provided me with training materials that gave me the competence in Spritekit quirks and api to build this game. He was also there to listen as I bounced ideas off of him and gave me the feedback I needed to keep going. Thanks Matt. 

**Amit Bijlani** - Amit is an instructor at Team Treehouse, a website with web development tutorials and courses. His course "Build a Game with Spritekit" was a great way to get familiar with Spritekit quickly. The course was well-made and gave a good overview of Spritekit's core features. It was a very painless way to learn, and overall I enjoyed the course. Thanks Amit.

**Garry Furnari** - Garry is a recruiter at InfoTech Solutions. He really motivated me to build this game so that I could show it off to potential employers. Not only did he push me to get it finished and put the time in, but knowing that he was sending it out to clients really made me want to make high quality source files. The code is nicely commented now, properly indented, and should hopefully make the programming masters proud. Thanks Garry.  

And to everyone else who has supported me directly or indirectly with this project, thanks.
