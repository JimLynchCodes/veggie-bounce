# Veggie Bounce 
##### A Spritekit Game by Jim Lynch

## About
This is veggie bounce. Veggie Bounce is an objective-C game for iphones and ipads. It was made in xcode and is built on the Spritekit framework. From a user's perspective Veggie Bounce is a relatively simple game where you collect as many points as possible while keeping the veggies from falling past the bottom of the screen. 

## Purpose
There are a few reaons why I created this game. One is to use this as an official sample of code for myself as I try to obtain a position as an Ios developer and programmer. After working on employers' projects using the standard storyboard method I wanted to give Spritekit a go and make a game with some interesting physics. Finally, I made this app for the public so that novice Ios developers can take a look at the code and get some ideas for their own projects.  

## How to Run the Project
Right now the only way to play the game is to run it in xcode. Open the project (veggie-bounce/Veg Bounce/Veg Bounce.xcodeproj) and click run. The app should work on Iphones 5, 5s, 6, and 6plus. It should also run fine on Ipad retina and Ipad air. You may need to change the file paths of frameworks to reflet the location on your own computer.
